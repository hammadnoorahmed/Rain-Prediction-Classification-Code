# Rain-Prediction-Classification-Code
This repository contain python code for Decision Tree classfication which was used for Rain Prediction dataset. 

The following steps as indicated by industry practices were taken:

1. EDA was performed to check data and types of its various features. 

2. Missing values and inconsistent values were dealt accordingly.

3. A correlation matrix was used to check the correlation for important features.

4. Outliers were detected and removed from the dataset. 

5. Data was prepared for the machine learning algorithm by ensuring distribution of all features was normal. For this purpose standard scaler and min max scalers were used. This exercise also ensured that scaling is same of all features for better prediction.

6. Categorical columsn were treated with red hot encoding to finally prepare data set for prediciton.

7. Decision Tree algorithm using Entropy and Gini was applied and finally their accuracy was determined to check how accurate our model is. Lastly, confusion matrix and classification report was also crafted to check how much more improvement can be done in the model.
